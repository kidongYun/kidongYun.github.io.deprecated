### 1. The concept of DTO and VO.

> A data transfer object's purpose is to represent the data to be transferred to another process, e.g. from your backend to a web frontend. If the information you are transferring has a nested structure, also using a nested type for the DTO does make sense. However, the DTO must not include unnecessary data you aren't actually using â€“ that's just misleading.

> A DTO is absolutely not the same as your domain model. Your model describes entities like a Customer or an Order with all properties that are relevant for your problem domain. This includes properly modelling the relationship between an Order and a Customer. It is not unusual to end up with a complex object graph describing all of these relationships (and equivalently: many foreign keys in a relational database).

> VO is usually known as the represent for expressing the objective attributes. so It is used by the business part of the system. Whenever you should to get the structure of some object then It's the good choice to check the VO file, which will help you understand their business.

### Why do we separate DTO and VO?

> First of all, We couldn't treat the source code in only one file. Having you used just the VO without DTO, this VO should include a lot of information like the validation code, for connecting jpa, the jaxb options and so on. These many information would gave us the big confusion. 

> Secondly, The parameters of the client request could be different as the thing is required. So the thinking to use only one domain model for taking the request is do not well. It always has the posibility be changed.

> Thirdly, We should be certainly the purpose when you create some sourece code. To separate DTO and VO is the good way to make sure the purpose.
