> Do you know the function of Load Balancer in the network? if you have just a one web server and the number of your customer is not too many, then actually You don't need it. But your service is big enough and when you think to consider about expanding your server system because of lack of the server bandwidth. then You can select two ways for solving this maybe.

```
    1. Buy the new one more expensive and bigger then before.
        - The important thing is this solution can't use your previous server.
    
    2. Buy the new one which is same spec with before.
        - If you use the Load Balancer for those, then you can use both. 
```

> in this situration, You can use the Load Balancer and ALB(Amazon Load Balancer) is also same concept function with the above. and the main function of Load Balancer is distribution of traffic. in ALB, You can categorize the one as the criteria of data like L2, L3, L4 and L7. and You can prepare for any disorder occured in server. <br><br> You can see the below screen when you press the tab named 'Load Balancers' located in left side menu.
