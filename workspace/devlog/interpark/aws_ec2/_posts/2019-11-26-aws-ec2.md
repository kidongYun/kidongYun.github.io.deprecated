### EC2 

> EC2 means the abbreviation of 'Elastic Compute Cloud'. We can define this using just one word. It's a computer. but EC2 actually can change every hardware spec like Capacity of SSD, The type of CPU, The Capacity of RAM...  It's literally Cloud Computer. so It can change many hardware things more easiler than normal computer. so now We will install this EC2 at our Subnet made previous article. Let start.

Acutally AMI is the abbreviation of 'Amazon Machine Image'. in the AWS system, We can't install any programs using physical way like CD, USB because AWS is definitely Cloud Service. so AWS already occur this AMI function for installing the programs for customer convenience. We usually use AMI for installing OS like Windows Server or Linux. <br><br> Let's select the second thing called 'Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type'
