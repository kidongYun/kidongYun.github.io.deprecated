## What is the O.O.P ?

> I don't want to consider the technical things at here for explaining O.O.P. I just wanna express this more simply, easily and intuitively.
I always think that O.O.P means the combination between data and method.

```
    Object = data + method
```

> Actually, a lot of the books are related to the O.O.P are introduced the above concept. and I really agree about this idea.
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Information Hiding are just a feature of the object. in other words
It doesn't means that they are not able to explain the core of O.O.P concept. 

> Some books said The O.O.P has created for express the everything in the world, but i really would like to think 
the programming language is not a complex. I just believe, someday, some code might be needed the unification at a once and
we maybe use the function technique for solving it.

> in the programming perspective, The O.O.P use the object __(data + method)__ for theusability, code re
