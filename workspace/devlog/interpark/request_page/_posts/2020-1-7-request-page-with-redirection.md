> I usually felt the needs of this request page whenever I develop the some project. Actually When we make the any api services, Usually we use the _postman_ or the _swagger_ tools. but These are only for the api test so I couldn't take real UI view when I used them. so I made this page really simplely but It's powerful. <br><br> If you should test your site entering from another site, then use this.
